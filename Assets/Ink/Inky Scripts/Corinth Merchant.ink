Welcome to the city-state, Corinth! We are a proud city! Thanks be to Zeus! Since we have access to both the Ionian and Aegean Sea, we are one of the most powerful cities in the world! #speaker:Merchant #portrait:merchant #layout:right
We were one of the first to develop coins and continue to be one of the wealthiest city-states in all of Greece! 
I am a humble merchant. Trade is my life. I take my boat all around the Mediterranean Sea, Ionian Sea, and Aegean Sea. I also take trips to many of the islands surrounding Greece.
The waters can be quite dangerous and my ship is built for strength, not speed. It can take weeks to travel from one city-state to another, especially some of the far away islands, like Crete.
The god of the sea, the mighty Poseidon, protects us!
Gee, I've been talking a bunch... Am I making sense?
+[Yes]
    You sure are! #speaker:Hero #portrait:hero #layout:left

+[No]
    Sorry, could you repeat that? #speaker:Hero #portrait:hero #layout:left

Being a merchant is a tough job, but somebody has to do it! We donâ€™t have many natural resources on the islands. Trade makes life throughout the Mediterranean Sea much better! #speaker:Merchant #portrait:merchant #layout:right
Olive oil, pottery, grains, timber, and metal are some of the most valuable items we trade.
I hope I haven't been too boring...

Did you catch what I said? 
Of course I did! You said that Corinth is:  #speaker:Hero #portrait:hero #layout:left

    We do have lots of grain at the Agora, but we're much more than agriculture. #speaker:Merchant #portrait:merchant #layout:right

Well, I should get going... This olive oil isn't going to deliver itself. Where should I sail?
You should sail to the: #speaker:Hero #portrait:hero #layout:left

Oh, great idea! #speaker:Merchant #portrait:merchant #layout:right
    There are tons of trade ports all over the Mediterranean. I'm sure I could find plenty of people to trade with!

It will take a while to get there. I could go south and sail through the Aegean, but that would take even longer...#speaker:Merchant #portrait:merchant #layout:right
Do you remember the name of the other sea? It's the one right here that we're looking at right next to us, by the way. #speaker:Merchant #portrait:merchant #layout:right
Of course I do! We're right next to the: #speaker:Hero #portrait:hero #layout:left

That's the one! Northwest through the Ionian, then we're into the vast Mediterranean. #speaker:Merchant #portrait:merchant #layout:right
